You're referring to **Rasa X** (I believe) and the `rasa` framework for building chatbots. To run Rasa locally inside your Android app, you can integrate it directly with your Kotlin app without relying on HTTP APIs. The method you're likely thinking of is **Rasa Core** (for conversation management) and **Rasa NLU** (for natural language understanding), which can be run locally on your device using `rasa` in combination with **Chaquopy**, a plugin for running Python code in Android.

Here’s how you can achieve that step by step:

### 1. **Set Up Rasa on Your Local Machine**
First, ensure that you have a working Rasa environment set up locally.

- Install Rasa:
  ```bash
  pip install rasa
  ```

- Create a new Rasa project:
  ```bash
  rasa init
  ```

- Train your Rasa model (this will generate the `nlu_model` and `core_model` that you can use later in your Android app):
  ```bash
  rasa train
  ```

- Make sure everything is working locally on your machine before proceeding.

### 2. **Set Up Android Project with Chaquopy**
Chaquopy lets you run Python code inside your Android app. This will be used to execute the Rasa model locally on Android.

1. **Add Chaquopy to Your Kotlin Android Project:**

   In your project’s `build.gradle` file (the one in the root of your project), add the following:
   ```gradle
   buildscript {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath "com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.2"
           classpath "com.chaquo.python:gradle:9.1.0"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Chaquopy Plugin to Your App Module:**

   In your `app/build.gradle` file, apply the plugin:
   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
   apply plugin: 'com.chaquo.python'

   android {
       ...
   }

   python {
       pip {
           install "rasa"
       }
   }

   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.chaquo.python:chaquopy:9.1.0'
   }
   ```

3. **Create Python Code for Rasa:**

   In your Android app, you’ll need to write some Python code that loads the trained Rasa model and performs inference. Create a Python file, for example `rasa_model.py` under `src/main/python/` in your app.

   ```python
   import rasa
   from rasa.core.agent import Agent
   from rasa.core.interpreter import RasaNLUInterpreter

   # Load your trained Rasa model
   model_path = "/path_to_your_model"  # Make sure this is the correct local path
   interpreter = RasaNLUInterpreter(model_path + "/nlu_model")
   agent = Agent.load(model_path + "/core_model", interpreter=interpreter)

   def get_response(user_input):
       responses = agent.handle_text(user_input)
       return responses[0]["text"] if responses else "Sorry, I didn't understand that."
   ```

### 3. **Integrate Python Code in Kotlin**
Now, in your Kotlin activity, you can interact with the Python code that you've written:

1. **Call Python Code from Kotlin:**

   In your `MainActivity.kt` or the appropriate activity:
   ```kotlin
   import com.chaquo.python.Python
   import com.chaquo.python.android.PythonActivity

   class MainActivity : PythonActivity() {

       override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

           val python = Python.getInstance()
           val py = python.getModule("rasa_model")  // The Python file name, e.g., rasa_model.py

           val response = py.callAttr("get_response", "Hello!")
           Log.d("RasaResponse", response.toString())
       }
   }
   ```

   In this code:
   - `get_response` is the Python function you created earlier.
   - `rasa_model` refers to the Python script file you wrote.

2. **Test the Integration:**

   When you run the Android app, it will call the `get_response` function, sending text to your Rasa model and receiving the chatbot response locally on your Android device.

### 4. **Package the Models with Your Android App:**

You need to make sure that the Rasa models (`nlu_model` and `core_model`) are bundled with your Android APK. You can put them in the `assets` folder of your Android project and modify the path to the models in the Python script accordingly.

To add them to the `assets` folder:
- Create a folder called `assets` in `src/main/` of your Android project.
- Place the `nlu_model` and `core_model` inside this `assets` folder.

In the Python code, adjust the model loading path:
```python
import os
import android
from pathlib import Path

def get_model_path():
    droid = android.Android()
    assets_dir = droid.getExternalStorageDirectory().result + "/assets/"
    return os.path.join(assets_dir, "models")

model_path = get_model_path()
```

### 5. **Final Considerations:**
- **Performance**: Running Rasa locally might consume significant resources, depending on the size of your model. Make sure to test performance on lower-end devices.
- **Memory/Storage**: Large Rasa models might take up a considerable amount of space. Make sure your app is optimized for storage.
- **Offline functionality**: Since you are running the model locally, it will work offline as long as you have the Rasa models packaged inside your app.
